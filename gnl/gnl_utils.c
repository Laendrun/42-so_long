 * the main function get_next_line "only" makes some check

 * once all the checks are done, it calls the _filL_line_buffer function
 * to read in the file descriptor until it finds a \n or \0 character
 * once the line variable is filled, we free the buffer so we don't have
 * any memory leaks, since it's not used after that.
 * once the buffer is freed, we set the line with the _set_line function
 * and we return the line, storing the return of the _set_line function
 * in a static variable, so that next time we call the get_next_line function
 * we have access to the first characters of the line that may have been read
 * before.
 * i.e. our file is "1\n234\n", our BUFFER_SIZE is 4
 * te first time we'll read through the file we'll read 1\n23
 * so what we are going to store in our static variable is '23', because the
 * next time we call the function on the same fd it will read
